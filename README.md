# 🥁 DrumXRoll – XR Drum Learning System  
*A Unity-based multimodal drumming tutor for Meta Quest 3*

---

## 📌 Overview  
**DrumXRoll** is an extended-reality (XR) drum-learning system built in **Unity** for the **Meta Quest 3**.  
It teaches drumming fundamentals through a **piano-roll–style visualizer**, **interactive lesson modes**, and **physical drum-set integration**.  
The system blends gesture tracking, spatial cues, and real-time feedback to help learners practice rhythm, timing, and limb coordination.

Key features include:

- 🎼 Piano-roll note visualizer  
- 🥁 Drum-hit detection & interaction logic  
- 🎧 Metronome, timing windows, audio feedback  
- 🕹️ Multiple lesson modes (Watch & Listen, Try Yourself, Compose on the Fly, Constraint & Create, etc.)  
- 🎮 XR integration for Meta Quest 3  
- 🧩 UI/UX flows, managers, scene controllers, and core scripts  

This repository contains the **Unity project scripts**, **project settings**, and **package definitions** required to run DrumXRoll.

## 🥁 About DrumXRoll  
DrumXRoll is designed to make drumming practice more immersive and intuitive by combining:

- **Visual learning** via spatialized falling notes  
- **Kinesthetic learning** using real and virtual drums  
- **Adaptive lesson flows** suited to beginner and intermediate drummers  
- **Instant feedback** for timing accuracy and consistency  

The system is developed under the **Human-X Interactions Lab (HXIL)** at **De La Salle University** for research on XR-based music learning.
