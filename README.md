DrumXRoll – XR Drum Learning System

A Unity-based multimodal drumming tutor for Meta Quest 3

📌 Overview

DrumXRoll is an extended-reality (XR) drum learning system built in Unity for the Meta Quest 3.
The system teaches drumming skills using a piano-roll–style visualizer, interactive lesson modes, and physical drum-set integration. It blends gesture tracking, real-time feedback, and immersive spatial cues to help learners develop rhythm, timing, and limb coordination.

The project includes core components such as:

🎼 Piano-roll note visualizer

🥁 Drum-hit detection & interaction logic

🎧 Audio feedback, timing windows, and metronome flows

🕹️ Lesson modes (Watch & Listen, Try Yourself, Compose on the Fly, Constraint & Create, etc.)

🎮 XR input integration for Quest 3

🧩 Scene management, flow controllers, UI/UX scripts, etc.

This repository contains all Unity scripts, managers, and project settings required to open and build the project in Unity.

🥁 About the Experience

DrumXRoll aims to make drumming more engaging, approachable, and expressive through:

Visual learning (falling notes, roll lines, timing cues)

Kinesthetic learning (interacting with real/virtual drums)

Adaptive practice modes that support different learning styles

Immediate feedback for timing, accuracy, and consistency

The system is currently used for research under the Human-X Interactions Lab (HXIL) at DLSU.
